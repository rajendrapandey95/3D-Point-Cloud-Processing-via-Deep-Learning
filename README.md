## Introduction

3D point clouds are collections of points in a three-dimensional space, typically obtained from LiDAR or photogrammetry. They represent the surface geometry of objects and environments, making them essential for applications requiring spatial awareness and precision. This project leverages state-of-the-art deep learning architectures to analyze and interpret 3D point clouds, enhancing their application in real-world scenarios.

## Objectives

### Feature Extraction
- Implement neural network architectures specifically designed for 3D data, including PointNet, PointNet++, DGCNN (Dynamic Graph CNN), and PointConv.
- Utilize 3D-adapted convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to capture both local and global geometric features.

### Algorithm Development
- **Classification**: Develop algorithms to categorize individual objects within a point cloud, identifying features such as vehicles, pedestrians, and urban elements.
- **Segmentation**: Create models to segment the point cloud into meaningful sub-regions, such as separating vehicles from roads or distinguishing between different vegetation types.
- **Object Detection**: Design systems to detect and locate specific objects within a point cloud, crucial for applications like autonomous driving.

## Architectural Framework

Our implementation leverages the following neural network architectures:
- **PointNet** and **PointNet++**: Pioneering methods for directly processing point clouds.
- **DGCNN (Dynamic Graph CNN)**: Captures local structures by dynamically constructing graphs.
- **PointConv**: Applies convolution operations to point clouds.

## Datasets

We utilize several benchmark datasets for training and evaluation:
- **ModelNet40**: A large-scale 3D CAD model dataset for classification tasks.
- **ShapeNet**: A richly annotated, large-scale dataset of 3D shapes.
- **KITTI**: An autonomous driving dataset for object detection and segmentation.
